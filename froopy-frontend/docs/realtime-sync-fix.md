# Real-time Message Synchronization Fix

## Problem
Messages were not syncing between both users in real-time. One user could send messages, but the other user wouldn't receive them.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Realtime Publication
The `messages` table was not added to the `supabase_realtime` publication. Without this, Postgres changes wouldn't trigger real-time events.

**Fix**: Created migration `20250128000003_enable_realtime_messages.sql` to add all necessary tables to the publication:
```sql
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE messages;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE matches;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE waiting_pool;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE friends;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE friend_messages;
```

### 2. Channel Naming Mismatch
- **ChatService** was using channel name: `chat:${matchId}` (with colon)
- **MatchingService** was using channel name: `chat-${matchId}` (with hyphen)

This meant the services were on different channels and couldn't communicate.

**Fix**: Updated MatchingService to use the same naming convention as ChatService.

### 3. Duplicate Subscriptions
Both ChatService and MatchingService were subscribing to the same postgres_changes events, causing potential conflicts:
- ChatService subscribed and called the onMessage callback
- MatchingService subscribed and dispatched custom events

**Fix**: Commented out the duplicate subscription in MatchingService, delegating all chat functionality to ChatService.

## Implementation Details

### ChatService (Primary Chat Handler)
- Subscribes to channel: `chat:${matchId}`
- Handles all incoming messages via postgres_changes
- Filters out own messages to prevent duplicates
- Loads existing messages on initialization

### MatchingService (Match Coordination Only)
- No longer handles chat subscriptions
- Focuses only on match creation and management
- Chat functionality delegated to ChatService

### Message Flow
1. User sends message → ChatService.sendMessage()
2. Message inserted into database
3. Postgres triggers real-time event
4. Both users' ChatService instances receive the event
5. Sender filters out their own message (already displayed optimistically)
6. Receiver displays the new message

## Testing
Created `test-realtime-messages.html` to verify:
1. Messages table is in realtime publication
2. Subscriptions work correctly
3. Messages are properly inserted and broadcast

## Result
Messages now sync properly between both users in real-time. The fix ensures:
- ✅ No duplicate subscriptions
- ✅ Consistent channel naming
- ✅ Proper realtime publication setup
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns between services
